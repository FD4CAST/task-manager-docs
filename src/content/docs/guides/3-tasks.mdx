## Features

- You can view your tasks in both list and calendar views.
- There are two types of calendar views: Inbuilt Calendar and Google Calendar.
- To use Google Calendar, you need to integrate your Google account with this application. Read this [guide](/guides/6-integrations#google-calendar) to learn how to integrate your Google account.
- Both Calendars offer you the ability to view your tasks in day, week, and month view. The agenda view is also available in both Calendars.
- You can also integrate it with `Slack` to receive `Slack notifications` whenever a new task is created or updated. Read this [guide](/guides/6-integrations#slack) to learn how to integrate it with `slack`.
- Task reminder notification is also inbuilt. Each user who has been assigned a task will receive a reminder notification on the reminder date and on the day of the deadline if the task is still pending.
- You will also receive a notification if you have turned on reminders on Google Calendar.
- Additionally, you can export your tasks in CSV format.

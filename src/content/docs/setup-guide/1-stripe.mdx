## Creating Stripe Account

- Create Stripe Account
- Grab Credentials
- Complete account profile

:::note
Stripe integration is optional. The application has inbuilt Invoice Generation tool that will generate the inovice but it won't generate `Payment Page` like the way Stripe does. You can however send payment details in the footer of the invoice.
